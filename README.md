Amazon Clone is a responsive e-commerce front-end replica of the Amazon website,
created using only HTML and CSS. This project showcases a clean layout of Amazonâ€™s homepage,
featuring a navigation bar, banner section, product cards, and a structured footer.
The goal of this clone is to practice building real-world layouts and improve front-end development skills without using any JavaScript or frameworks.
